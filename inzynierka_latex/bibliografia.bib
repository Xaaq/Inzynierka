abstract="The Cellular Automata (CA) paradigm has been recognized as an effective approach used in the modeling and simulation of complex systems. However, its classical form of a homogeneous and synchronous CA has a limited field of applications. For practical applications, non-homogeneous and asynchronous CAs with hybrid technological construction are especially useful in modeling and simulation. In this article, the authors focus on crowd simulations based on CA and agent-based modeling approaches. Basic technical aspects of large-scale crowd simulations are presented: specifically proposed architecture, our view on synchronization patterns, as well as hierarchy of objects in logic and data layer. A new method of agent conflict resolution is also proposed. Such an approach was successfully applied in the Allianz Arena stadium model, and other large-scale simulations developed by the authors. Thus, finally, practical applications of the models are presented.",
